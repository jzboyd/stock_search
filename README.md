stock search project 1

I utilized jquery for an ajax call for my stock market API to get both a company overview and stock quote.

My approach to this project was to first decide what information I wanted to get from the API. Once I identified both URL's that would give me both the company overview and the stock quote. I then made two ajax calls to pull the data.

Input a stock symbol in the search bar. Click the stock quote button to get a quote from the latest trading day.

Unsolved Problems - I am still unable to indiviually click the stock quote button. When I pull up another stock card it will not allow me to click the second stock quote button. If I click the original stock quote button it will then pull up the new searches button and cycle back to the original one.
